/**
 *Notes For this TeleOp Code. This code is for Comp and all proggramers should review over this
 *code and understand this code for the possibility that a question may be asked related to TeleOp and
 *you should be able to explain in good detail everything in this code.
 *11/16/17-> Changed all gamepad's in code to correct gamepad (i.e some gamepad1's to gamepad2)
 ***11/18/17-> Competition Notes below
 *Notes-> Autonomous is incorrect, Not much was wrong from a software sandpoint but hardware issues were fixed
 *Autonomous issues included: Incorrect spinning causing us to move out of destination,
 *To much time on the down motion of the clamp and arm.
 *These issues are still not resolved
 * Recomendation for autonomous issues(Not Offical):Fine tune the timer on the clamp
 * Fine tune the movements and LOWER the TIME OF MOVEMENT in autonomous.
 * List of issues at Comp(1)-> https://docs.google.com/a/stjoebears.com/spreadsheets/d/1r_liipKBU7GHfONdxq9E6d4f7zikcCuXwDL2bsQfwm0/edit?usp=sharing
